# html_experiment

This is a simple Makepad app that shows off a few Html widgets.

## Building and running

### Local build set up
Currently this expects a local copy of the `makepad` project as a sibling directory, with a directory structure like so:
```
projects
├── makepad
└── html_experiment
```

The `makepad` project should be checked out to the [latest commit of branch `rik`](https://github.com/makepad/makepad/tree/rik).

### Running
On native desktop, simply run:
```sh
cargo run
```
